            <img src="./images/general/rescue-facility.jpg" alt="Volunteers caring for animals at our rescue facility" width="600">
            <p>Paws & Claws Animal Rescue was created in 2015 by a group of dedicated animal lovers who recognised a serious need in our community.  We first started with a single foster family and have now grown into a huge group of dedicated volunteers who work thoroughly to give voice to the voiceless.</p>
            <p>Over the years, we've rescued and found loving homes for over 2,000 animals. Each one has a special place in our hearts, and each successful adoption fuels our passion to continue this important work.</p>
