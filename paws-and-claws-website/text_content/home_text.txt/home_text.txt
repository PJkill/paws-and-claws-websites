Paws & Claws Animal Rescue

- Welcome to Paws & Claws Animal Rescue

We are dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming our community's abandoned and neglected animals. Every pet deserves another opportunity at a happy life and a welcoming home.

-Featured Pets Ready for Adoption

These are just a few of our wonderful friends looking for their forever homes. Could it be you to help them find one?

-Bella, 2 Years
Bella is playful and sometimes grumpy, but when grumpy she does funny things. She loves sleeping and cuddles on the couch. She is great with children and other dogs or cats.

-Max, 5 Years
Max is a calm and affectionate gentleman. He enjoys sunny spots and gentle petting. He would thrive in a quiet home.

-Rex, 1 Year
Rex is a smart and loyal companion eager to please. He is looking for an active family who can continue his training.
